# BingoTeacher

BingoTeacher is a tool used by the Ocarina of Time speedrunning community to help learn the Bingo game variant. Bingo requires a ton of tricks that many players don't know, and therefore has a large barrier to entry. This tool attempts to make Bingo more approachable, allowing users to enter goals from their bingo cards and instantly have video tutorials for all the tricks they may not know which are required to complete the goals.

## Publicly Deployed Version [Users Looking to Learn Bingo]

Bingo Teacher is deployed on GitHub pages at https://qwoodmansee.github.io/bingo-teacher/ - if you'd like to see the tool work, manually search for a goal and select it. Due to the volume of videos per goal, this tool is most easily used on a desktop browser.

## New Acrchitecture Deployed Version [Users looking to contribute to the source data]

Bingo teacher's user provided content project has just begun. See the production deploy of this repostiory at https://bingot-cms.vercel.app/ for the most recent updates.

## Running Locally

This repository is brand new and local development is not truly supported due to a hard dependency on a live production CMS. In the future, a blog post will be posted which will call for assistance in development. If anyone is super familiar with setting up a mock layer for contentful, i'd happily consider a proposal/draft PR.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. All code is required to be tested in a dedicated file, and all lint rules are strongly enforced for code style consistency. Standalone commits with details messages are always appreciated.

## Development Tools

This application uses NextJs (React) linked to Contentful, Deployed via Vercel. A local development environment which does not support these tools would be necessary to contribute at the moment.
